Hello All,

I am Neha Lad. I am pursuing Masters in DAEN. I am a part time student and was a full time employee in GMU till 30th Aug. 

1. No. Though I was working as a Applicaton Analyst with GMU till 30th Aug 2019. I was basically handling the backend part of ITSM tool.

2. My goal for this course is to explore the technologies that are used to organize, manage and simplify Big Data. I have a very little idea when it comes to dealing with big data and hence, I think this course might help me to clarify my concepts.

3. I am a part time student, this is my third semester and 4th course.

4. I have opted for AIT 622 with AIT 580 for this semester.

5. I have completed my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2010. After that, I have worked with Barclays for 5+ yrs. I was working with GMU for more than a year now. Earlier, I have opted for STAT 515 in Spring 2019, OR 531 and AIT 580 in Summer 2019.

6. I am well versed in Cognos BI (Reporting tool). Beside this I have worked on SQL and ITSM tool in GMU. I have a little exposure to ETL tools like informatica and ab-initio.
