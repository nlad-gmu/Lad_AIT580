I am Neha Lad. I am pursuing Masters in DAEN. I am a part time student and was a full time employee in GMU till 30th Aug.

## Educational & Professional Background

I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2010.
I have experience of 7+ years in IT sector specializing in Business Intelligence and DataWarehouse.

## Course Goal

My goal for this course is to explore the technologies that are used to organize, manage and simplify Big Data. I have a very little idea when it comes to dealing with big data and hence, I think this course might help me to clarify my concepts.
