URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2017/08/08/xiaomi-is-once-again-worlds-biggest-smartphone-brand-but-could-it-go-further/#3f9a77921691

This graph provides unnecessary details clubbed in a single visualization.
Problems:
1) the grouping of these 3 comparative bar charts forces us to find the common link between these 3, but there isn't any link between them at all.

2) The first bar chart is using percentage and the second one is using numbers in millions as a scale. Their scale has nothing to do with each other.

3) They have clubbed three charts unnecesaarily which are giving details that are not comparable at all.

Solution:

1) 3 different barcharts could be opted as they all represent 3 different level of details.

2) for comparing china and global market at individual level, they can go for a common scale either percentage or no in million.

3) The graph could use more space to breath, in terms of chart options and legends usage. 

2. Find one example of misleading interpretation (paste the URL of the news page), explain the problem and suggest a solution (5 points)

Misleading Visualization: https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/03/01/social-media-use-in-2018/

The graph in this article is quiet misleading

Problems:
1) The graph shows that the increase is facebook usage could lead to target more and more audience, however the year trends shows that from 2016 to 2018 the growth has been flat, hence we cannot say that the no of audience that we could reach out is more. In short the trend shown here is misleading.

2)the graphs shows a considerable increase in the use of instagram (approx from 28 to 35) but it doesn't consider the section of the society which is showing this trend. though they mention it in their article that this increase is due to youngster, but there is no scope for comparison in the graph.

3) The color combination of lines could use more bright colors, in order to differentiate when they overlap and separate.

Solutions:
1) The graph could use a better visualization like stacked bar chart with years or bubble chart with years to show the increase in trends. this will reduce the apin to judge overlapping sections for those years.

2) the scale could be no of millions instead of percentage, so that the flat growth can be interpreted in a better way

3) the grph could be distributed for types of user, if you need to target audience in a effective way.
